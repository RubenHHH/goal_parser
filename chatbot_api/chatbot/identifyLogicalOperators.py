#     Given the user's message(s) after </SYS>, identify the relationships between the already identified intents listed after </SYS>.
    
#     Relationship:
#     - Relationships can be the following: 'and', 'or', 'one_of', 'seq'
#     - Relationships can describe the connections between the intents specified after </SYS>
#     - Relationships can describe the connection between connected intents as explained above
 
#     Explanation:
#     - 'and': Indicates that its surrounding intents are desired, showing an additive relationship.
#     - 'or': Suggests a choice between its surrounding intents, where one or the other (or one of several) is desired.
#     - 'one_of': Specifies a choice of exactly one desired intent from a list of intents.
#     - 'seq': Indicates a sequence of desired intents, where the order of actions is important based on the context, not necessarily the order at which they are mentioned in the sentence.
    
#     Output rules:
#     - Do NOT output anything other than the intents and their relationships
#     - Structure the relationships as follows ('INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS' is a placeholder value for identied intents or relationships between them, and '...' is a placeholder value for a continuation of the same pattern):
#         - 'and': '[INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS and INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS and ...]'
#         - 'or: '[INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS or INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS or ...]'
#         - 'one_of': 'one of [INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS ; INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS ; INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS ; ...]'
#         - 'seq': 'seq [INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS ; INTENT_OR_RELATED_INTENTS ; ...]'
#     - The whole output should conform to the rules
#     - Your response must strictly be one of the given format, based on the user's input. Do not include any additional explanations, greetings, or any text beyond what is specified here.
#     - Minimize how verbose your output is. Your input should start with '[' and end with ']', which means that you should NOT mention which operators you have identified seperately.

prefix_identifyLogicalOperations = """
Task Instruction:
 
Your objective is to analyze user requests (between <<< and >>> after </SYS>) and accurately identify logical relationships between specified intents. These relationships can be expressed using four logical operators: `and`, `or`, `one_of`, and `seq`. Your response must strictly adhere to a predefined format that may involve nesting these operators to reflect complex intent relationships. Draw inspiration from provided examples to understand how to apply and structure these logical operators. The output should be concise, directly addressing user intent, without any additional explanations or text outside the specified format.
 
Logical Operators:
 
- `and`: Connects intents with an additive relationship, which means that the order is not important.
- `or`: Indicates a choice between intents, where any one or more could be desired.
- `one_of`: Specifies a choice of exactly one intent from a list.
- `seq`: Describes a sequence of intents, highlighting the importance of order.
 
Keywords that should be mapped to logical operators:
- `and`: `and`, `both...and`, `all of...`, `in addition...`
- `or`: `or`, `choose among...`
- `one_of`: `only`, `one of...`, `only...or`, `either...or`
- `seq`: `first ... then`, `in the order of`, `if...then`, `in sequence...`, `before`, `after`

Nesting Logical Operators:
 
Operators can be nested within each other to represent complex intent relationships. For example, an intent can be desired in conjunction with one of several other intents (`[intent1 and [intent2 or intent3]]`), or there may be a sequence where one step depends on choosing one of several options (`seq [intent1; one_of[intent2; intent3]]`).
 
Output Format:
 
Your response must strictly conform to the provided structure, starting with `+++[` and ending with `]===`, encapsulating the identified intents and their logical relationships.
Examples of correct format include:
- `+++[`intent1` and `intent2`]===`
- `+++[one_of [`intent1`; `intent2`; `intent3`]]===`
- `+++seq [`intent1`; `intent2`]===`
- `+++[`intent1` or `intent2`]===`
- `+++[[`intent1` and `intent2`] or `intent3`]===`
- `+++seq [[`intent1` or `intent2`] ; `intent3`]===`
- `+++one_of [`intent1` ; [`intent2` or `intent3`]]===`

 
Drawing Inspiration from Examples:
 
The provided examples are key to understanding how to apply these rules in practice. Each example demonstrates the application of logical operators, their potential for nesting, and the precise output format required. Ensure your outputs align with these examples in both structure and clarity.
 
Directing Output Towards User Intent:
 
Your output is directed towards understanding and addressing user intent as specified in their requests (between <<< and >>> after </SYS>). It should be laser-focused on identifying and structuring the logical relationships between intents, following the strict guidelines provided. Avoid including any additional information, greetings, or clarifications outside of the required format, as your output will be directly passed to the user.
